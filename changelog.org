#+TITLE: rfc-mode changelog

* Next Version
/Work in progress./

* 1.4.2
** Bugs
- Fix footer highlighting.

* 1.4.1
** Bugs
- Fix page-based navigation (thanks to Matthew Woodcraft for reporting the
  issue) on Emacs 29.
- Fix major-mode auto-detection for rfc-mode buffers.

* 1.4.0
I should have released minor versions for bug fixes, but it seems everyone is
using the =master= branch from MELPA, and so am I. So major only it is. I will
release a minor version if a severe issue is found of course.

** Features
- ~rfc-mode-read~ now supports a numeric prefix argument, so you can simply
  type ~C-u 1 2 3 4 M-x rfc-mode-read~ to read RFC number 1234. Also, if you
  call ~rfc-mode-read~ when point is on a number, you will be offered that
  number as default. Thanks to Daniel Martín.
- ~rfc-mode-goto-section~ now makes sure the title of the section is at the
  top of the page, avoiding annoying edge cases where a section is at the end
  of a page (thanks to Štěpán Němec).

** Misc
- Make the dependency on Helm optional (thanks to Jonas Bernoulli).
- Code cleaning and simplifications (thanks to Stefan Monnier, Jonas Bernoulli
  and Basil L. Contovounesios).

* 1.3.0
This release improves navigation and introduce section detection, thanks to
Daniel Martín.

** Features
- ~imenu~ integration. If you use a graphical user interface, the menu
  bar will show a new menu, "RFC Contents", with links to the
  different parts of an RFC document.
- RFC links can now be navigated using the mouse, or by pressing
  ~<Tab>~/~<S-Tab>~.
- Pressing ~g~ in a ~rfc-mode~ buffer lets you navigate to an RFC
  section by name.
- You can navigate to previous and next RFC sections by pressing ~p~ and
  ~n~, respectively.

** Misc
- Derive ~rfc-mode~ from ~special-mode~.
- Make ~rfc-mode-read~ display the document in a separate window,
  without switching buffers. This follows the typical Emacs convention
  for displaying help buffers, like ~help-mode~ or ~man-mode~ follow.

* 1.2.0
This new release is driven by suggestions from Stefan Monnier and some issues
which were open on Github. Thanks everyone!

** Features
- Let the module load without Helm since some features can be used without it.
- Auto load ~rfc-mode-read~.
- Improved accuracy for section title detection.
- Offer the possibility to keep original buffer names with
  ~rfc-mode-use-original-buffer-names~.

** Fixes
- Compute the index path dynamically so that ~rfc-mode-directory~ can be
  modified after the module has been loaded.

** Misc
- Follow Emacs conventions in docstrings.
- Derive ~rfc-mode~ from ~text-mode~.
- Use ~expand-file-name~ instead of ~concat~.
